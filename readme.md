# What is the context?

## The specifications

🛠️The main objectives of the course were :  

- Use a Microchip dsPICDEM 2 card with the dsPIC30F microcontroller
- Getting started with the ESP32 microcontroller
- Develop recognition program on Raspberry Pi 4 - Yolo Python, OpenCV
- Object / face tracing with EPS32 Servo and recognition on Raspberry

## The tools available

Our project is based on the programming of different cards. 

**The dsPICDEM 2 card :**

# The organisation

We divided the period into 4 weeks to handle each tool

**Week 1 -> 2 :**  
The goal is to get started with the Microship dsPICDEM 2 board.

**Week 2 -> 3 :**  
The goal is to perform MicroPython programming on the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi

**Week 3 -> 4 :**  
The goal is to develop a recognition program using the Raspberry Pi and the Pi Camera

The work is organised in 3 branches as follows:  
- MicroShip
- AI Recognition + ESP32  

To access them, do : 
```git
git checkout branchname # for example : Microchip or AI-Recognition  
```
